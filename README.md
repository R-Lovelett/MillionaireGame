# What I Learned

This project was one of my first fully functioning Java programs that I created during one of my first 
programming courses in college. It was initially created in BlueJ, but I imported the base code into IntelliJ to
upload to Github for the world to see! During the process of making this game, I was required to show my understanding of 
the following programming concepts:

- Object-Oriented Programming.
- Use of different variables such as int and String.
- Importing and utilizing another class.
- If-else statements.
- Either a "while" or "for" loop.
- Javadoc comments of various types.
